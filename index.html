                <p class="fader">Deforestation is one of the main causes of global warming. Since carbon dioxide is chemically stored in the trees, it gets released when the trees are cut down, and the absorption of that carbon dioxide is then lowered since there are less trees to do it. The climate change that can take place due to this will likely be the cause to the destruction of the planet and the extinction of all species including humanity.

                In North America, the number of trees has been cut down by half since the beginning of time. The greatest amount of deforestation is taking place in tropical rainforests due to their massive surface area, and the large potential of better road systems. Biodiversity is being threatened because tropical forests are home to many native species and the logging of such areas will result in the extinction of those species.

                <p class="fader">
                Moreover, the loss of trees from the soil can leave it prone to erosion and which causes all other plants and crops to be more vulnerable to fires as the environment shifts from being moist to dry. Even though deforestation has some benefits, it comes with many negative consequences that could lead to our extinction, which is why conservation methods have to be implemented before it is too late.

                <p class="fader">
                Want to make a worthy contribution alone? The most efficient personal strategy to fight against deforestation is to plant a tree and use less paper. Planting a tree is considered a lifelong investment into the environment, a healthy living, and your good mental health. Two million trees are also being cut every day just to supply the paper demand of the United States which is one out of 195 countries in the world. Using less paper - and ore technology - will decrease the worldwide demand  and potentially lead to a better future where we can live a paper-free life.
